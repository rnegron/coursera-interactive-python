This folder houses the source code of the Python programs I've written for Rice University's Coursera.org course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" in Fall 2013.  

I will only upload the source code once the period for submission for a particular program is over.

These scripts were written using CodeSkulptor (http://www.codeskulptor.org/) and are tested to work on CodeSkulptor as of November 2013.
